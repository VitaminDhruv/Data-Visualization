# Data-Visualization
Reading data and visualization 


---Develop a Jupyter Notebook to do the following, this is similar to the work in the ML-SciKit book:--

   a. Setup to read the data, you can obtain it directly from a URL or just read it from a local file. 
   b. Read and Load the data and then display it in a DataFrame
   c. get the info of the resulting data frame
   d. provide counts of some categories (numeric and other)
   e. provide a description of the resulting data
   f. plot the data as much as possible
   g. split the data into 20%, 80%. 
 
-> For this operation UCI dataset is used, any data set can be used for data visualtion as long as the path of that dataset is assigned correctly
